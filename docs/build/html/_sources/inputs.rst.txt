Phenotype file
--------------

Save your phenotype data as a tab-separated file as ``data/data.tsv``. The phenotype file should contain at least 4 columns with headers:

* ``strain``:  sample names.
* ``fasta``: relative or absolute path to the assemblies (SAMPLE.fasta).
* ``gff``: relative or absolute path to the annotations (SAMPLE.gff).
* ``phenotype``: target phenotype(s). There can be more than one target phenotye and the column name will be used in populating the output directory.

Subsequent columns can contain other target phenotypes and/or any covariate. Additional columns are allowed and will be simply ignored. See an example phenotype data from the `test data <https://github.com/microbial-pangenomes-lab/gwas_template/tree/main/test>`__::

.. note::
    Only the target variables/phenotype indicated in the ``config/config.yaml`` file will be used for the associations.
    See :doc:`usage` for more information.


Sample's genome sequences and annotations
-----------------------------------------

By default, the microGWAS pipeline takes the assemblies and annotations with the ``.fasta`` and ``.gff`` extensions.
Make sure that each sample assembly and annotation file follow this naming convention before running the analysis.
