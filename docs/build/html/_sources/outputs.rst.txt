General output folder structure
-------------------------------

Running the suggested pipeline rules (``annotate_summary find_amr_vag map_back manhattan_plots heritability enrichment_plots qq_plots tree``)
will yield the following
directory strcture in the ``out`` outputs folder:

.. note::
    If multiple phenotypes are defined in the config file, there will be multiple folders in ``associations`` and ``wg``.

Output files
------------

The above directories will contain the following files:

..  code-block:: console

    out
    |____abritamr
    | |____summary_virulence.txt
    | |____summary_matches.txt

The virulence associated genes (VAGs) will be listed in the ``summary_virulence.txt`` file
(under the column ``Virulence``),
while the antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) will be listed in the ``summary_matches.txt`` file,
with one column per antimicrobial "class".

* ``inputs`` folder: the ``distances.tsv``, ``linages.tsv``, ``lineages_covariance.tsv``, ``phenotypes.tsv``, and ``similarity.tsv`` files contain the association inputs for each target phenotype, so that they only contain the samples for which the phenotypic data is available 
* ``annotated_*.tsv``: contains the annotations of genes to which variants passing the association threshold map to; each row contains a gene, followed by the average associations' summary statistics, the frequency of the gene in the pangenome, the locus tag and gene name of the gene if it's encoded in the chosen reference(s), and finally the annotations given by ``eggnog-maper``, including COGs, GO terms and KEGG annotations
* ``heritability_all.tsv``: contains information about what proportion of the phenotypic variation can be explained by either the lineage membership or the genetic variants. The `genetics` column indicates the likelihood model used for the heritability estimation, `lik` the likelihood model used for the heritability estimation, `h2`, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the genetic effects. 
* ``unitigs_lineage.txt``: lineage associations output; for each lineage the association p-value is reported; the name is misleading, as the unitigs presence/absence patterns have not been used for this association tests
* ``mapped.tsv``: mapping information on the unitigs passing the association threshold, across all samples and reference(s)
* ``mapped_all.tsv``: mapping information for all tested unitigs to the reference genome(s)
* ``panfeed.tsv``, ``rare.tsv``, ``struct.tsv``, ``unitigs.tsv``, and ``gpa.tsv``: contain the raw association results as given by ``pyseer``, with one file per variant set
* * ``panfeed_filtered.tsv``, ``rare_filtered.tsv``, ``struct_filtered.tsv``, ``unitigs_filtered.tsv``, and ``gpa_filtered.tsv``: contain the variants passing the association threshold
* ``manhattan.png``: manhattan plot for all unitigs mapping to the main reference genome
* ``qq_*.png``: QQ plot to assess the distribution of observed p-values with the expected distribution under the null hypothesis of the test statistics
* ``COG_*.tsv``, ``GO_*.tsv``, and ``KEGG_*.tsv``: functional enrichment tests results for each variant set
* ``COG_*.png``, ``GO_*.png``, and ``KEGG_*.png``: plots to visualise the results of the functional enrichment tests
* ``panfeed_annotated_kmers.tsv.gz``: detailed annotation of all k-mers mapping to associated gene clusters, as given by ``panfeed``
* ``panfeed_plots``: visualizaion of the gene-cluster specific k-mers, with 3 files for each associated gene cluster, as given by ``panfeed``

    | |____kmers_to_hashes.tsv
    | |____kmers.tsv
    | |____hashes_to_patterns.tsv
    
* ``kmers_to_hashes.tsv``: file used to match gene clusters, k-mer sequences and the hash for the respective presence/absence pattern.
* ``kmers.tsv``:  k-mers metadata file
* ``hashes_to_patterns.tsv``: file contains binary presence/absence matrix for all unique k-mer patterns (rows) across samples (columns)

    |____similarity.tsv
    |____distances.tsv
    |____annotated_reference.tsv

* ``similarity.tsv`` and ``distances.tsv`` provides information about the genetic reletedness of the test strains. They are both used to account for population structure during the association analysis. 
* ``annotated_reference.tsv`` is the functional annotation of the reference using ``eggnog-mapper``. It provides mappings to COG categories, KEGG terms, pathways and more.

    | | |____PROTEIN_ID_2.tsv.gz
    | | |____[...]
    
* ``rare.vcf.gz``: all rare deleterious variants identified across all samples merged into a single VCF file. 
* ``unet``: this directory contains, for each protein sequence encoded in the reference genome, the estimated impact of every possible non-synonymous variants. The ``pred`` column indicates the probability that a variant is deleterious; the pipeline uses a threshold of 0.5.

The contents of the ``wg`` are very similar to the equivalent files in the ``associations`` folder. The differences are:

* in the ``inputs`` subfolder: ``variants.*`` are the ``pyseer`` checkpoint files to avoid loading the full set of unitigsmultiple times 
* ``lasso.tsv``: association output between each unitig and the phenotype; based on the lasso model 
* ``lasso.txt``: the table shows the prediction perfomance of the lasso model; the size represents the number of samples, R2 the model performance and the True and False predictions for each lineage
* ``ridge.tsv``: association output between each unitig and the phenotype; based on the ridge model
* ``ridge.txt``: the table shows the prediction perfomance of the ridge model; the size represents the number of samples, R2 the model performance and the True and False predictions
* ``lasso.pkl`` and ``ridge.pkl``: ``pyseer`` checkpoint file containing the trained machine learning model, which can be used to predict the phenotype in new samples
